# MLOps_Pipeline_Project
This project implements an end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline with automated workflows and experiment tracking. The pipeline covers all major stages — data ingestion, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation — and is fully automated using DVC with dvc.yaml for reproducibility and version control.

It also integrates DVC Live for real-time tracking of metrics, parameters, and plots, making it easier to compare experiments and monitor model performance. The project supports configurable parameters, enabling flexible experimentation without changing the core code.
